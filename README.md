I had a need to capture a number of prompts to use in demo'ing AI prompts etc. so I came up with this simple chrome extension.

What it does:

1. Add, edit, remove clipboard entries - each entry can have a category
2. Being able to search entries (both text and categories)
3. Themeable - dark and light mode plus custom color schemes
4. Saves to your Google Drive for persistance
5. Tries to be accessible compliant
